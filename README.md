# Google Data Analytics Case Study

### Purpose / Goal

This repository is used to display the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act) I applied in order to provide a sufficent analysis on the `Cyclistic bike-share analysis` case study. 
This case study was given to us to complete as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certifcate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&utm_content=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&campaignid=12566515400&adgroupid=117869292685&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20analyst%20course&matchtype=p&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507290840627&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwjdOIBhA_EiwAHz8xm8gj8lt8i7ENqoqgn_r1vY1G9ix3tWoS8__ywb5-9R_a-jm-st3hhhoCfGAQAvD_BwE).

#### Additionals
When cloning / pulling this repo bear in mind you need to follow the instructions (requirements.txt) in the data-sets folder to obtain the correct data.
Reason for this is the datasets used are too big for github to directly handle.
